# Employee Attrition Prediction Project

## üìã Project Overview

This project aims to **predict employee turnover** using machine learning techniques, helping HR departments identify **risk factors** and **develop strategies** to retain talent. By understanding the factors contributing to employee attrition, organizations can take proactive measures to reduce turnover and improve employee satisfaction.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a **fictional employee attrition dataset** created by IBM data scientists. The dataset includes various employee attributes, such as job role, monthly income, years at the company, work-life balance, and more.

- **Data Source:** IBM Sample Dataset
- **Target Variable:** `Attrition` (whether an employee has left the company)

## üíª Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Checked for missing values and outliers.
   - Encoded categorical variables.
   - Scaled numerical features for improved model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed distributions of key features.
   - Visualized relationships between features and attrition.
   - Identified potential risk factors for employee turnover.

3. **Model Selection & Evaluation**  
   - Tested multiple machine learning algorithms:
     - **Logistic Regression**
     - **Random Forest**
     - **Gradient Boosting**
     - **Support Vector Machine**
     - **Neural Network**
   - Evaluated each model using **accuracy**, **F1 score**, and **ROC AUC** metrics.
   - Selected **Logistic Regression** as the final model due to its balance of interpretability and performance.

4. **Feature Importance Analysis**  
   - Identified top factors contributing to attrition, including job role, monthly income, and work-life balance.
   - Visualized feature importance to help HR teams focus on actionable areas.

5. **Results Visualization**  
   - Created visualizations to illustrate the model performance and key attrition factors.
   - Bar charts comparing accuracy, F1 score, and ROC AUC for each model.
   - Feature importance chart showcasing the top drivers of turnover.

## üìä Key Insights

- **Top Factors Influencing Attrition:**  
   The analysis identified several critical factors influencing employee attrition, including:
   - Job Role
   - Monthly Income
   - Work-Life Balance

- **Actionable Insights for HR:**  
   By focusing on these high-impact areas, HR departments can:
   - Develop targeted retention strategies for high-risk roles.
   - Explore adjustments to income structures or work-life balance policies.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.6+**
- Libraries: **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, **scikit-learn**

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-attrition-prediction.git
   cd employee-attrition-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
